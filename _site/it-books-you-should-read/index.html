But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with <em><strong>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</strong> </em>. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.</p><p>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.</p><p>_<strong>Clean Code</strong> _is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.</p><p><strong>Readers will come away from this book understanding:</strong></p><ul><li>How to tell the difference between good and bad code<li>How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code<li>How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes<li>How to format code for maximum readability<li>How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic<li>How to unit test and practice test-driven development</ul><p>This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.</p><h3 id="the-clean-coder-a-code-of-conduct-for-professional-programmers"><a href="https://amzn.to/2O0KP9i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Clean Coder<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</span></a></h3><p>Programmers who endure and succeed amidst swirling uncertainty and nonstop pressure share a common attribute: They care deeply about the practice of creating software.

Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude.

Businesses need to move more quickly than ever before, and large software organizations are applying these DevOps principles to develop new software faster than anyone previously thought possible. DevOps started in small organizations and in large organizations that had or created architectures that enabled small teams to independently develop, qualify, and deploy code. The impact on productivity is so dramatic that larger organizations with tightly coupled architectures are realizing they either need to embrace DevOps or be left behind.</p><p>The biggest challenge is that they can’t just empower small teams to work independently because their legacy architectures require coordinating the development, qualification, and deployment of code across hundreds of people. They need a DevOps approach that not only addresses their unique challenges, but also helps them reach an organization-wide agreement on where to start and how to scale DevOps. That is where Starting and Scaling DevOps in the Enterprise comes in. Starting and Scaling DevOps in the Enterprise is a quick, easy-to-read guide that helps structure those improvements by providing a framework that large organizations can use to understand DevOps principles in the context of their current development processes and gain alignment across the organization for successful implementations.</p><p>The book illustrates how to analyze your current development and delivery processes to ensure you gain positive momentum by implementing the DevOps practices that will have the greatest immediate impact on the productivity of your organization, with the goal of achieving continuous improvement over time.</p><h3 id="monolith-to-microservice-evolutionary-patterns-to-transform-your-monolith"><a href="https://amzn.to/38CX2uf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monolith to Microservice<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">: Evolutionary Patterns to Transform Your Monolith</span></a></h3><p>How do you detangle a monolithic system and migrate it to a microservice architecture?

Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process.</p><p><strong><em>Domain-Driven Design</em> </strong>fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development.</p><p>Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis–refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code–in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer. <strong><em>Domain-Driven Design</em> </strong>then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include:</p><ul><li>Getting all team members to speak the same language<li>Connecting model and implementation more deeply<li>Sharpening key distinctions in a model<li>Managing the lifecycle of a domain object<li>Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways<li>Making complex code obvious and predictable<li>Formulating a domain vision statement<li>Distilling the core of a complex domain<li>Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model<li>Applying analysis patterns<li>Relating design patterns to the model<li>Maintaining model integrity in a large system<li>Dealing with coexisting models on the same project<li>Organizing systems with large-scale structures<li>Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs</ul><p>With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.</p><h3 id="the-art-of-unit-testing"><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZG6EAl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Art of Unit Testing</a></h3><p><em>The Art of Unit Testing, Second Edition</em> guides you step by step from writing your first simple tests to developing robust test sets that are maintainable, readable, and trustworthy.

While some fear is healthy (often viewed as a conscience that tells programmers to “be careful!”), the author believes that byproducts of fear include tentative, grumpy, and uncommunicative programmers who are unable to absorb constructive criticism. When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them.</p><p>TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be continually tested and refactored. Kent Beck teaches programmers by example, so they can painlessly and dramatically increase the quality of their work.</p><h3 id="prometheus-up--running-infrastructure-and-application-performance-monitoring"><a href="https://amzn.to/3iyPT2x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prometheus: Up &amp; Running<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">: Infrastructure and Application Performance Monitoring</span></a></h3><p>Get up to speed with Prometheus, the metrics-based monitoring system used by tens of thousands of organizations in production.

Al Qaeda in Iraq was a decentralized network that could move quickly, strike ruthlessly, then seemingly vanish into the local population. The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment, and training—but none of that seemed to matter. To defeat Al Qaeda, they would have to combine the power of the world’s mightiest military with the agility of the world’s most fearsome terrorist network.

It is, at heart, a book about creativity—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.”</p><p>For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the <em>Toy Story</em> trilogy, <em>Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, WALL-E, _and _Inside Out, _which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really _is</em>. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.</p><p>As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his co-founding Pixar in 1986. Nine years later, <em>Toy Story</em> was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on leadership and management philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:</p><ul><li>Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.<li>If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.<li>It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.<li>The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.<li>A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.</ul><h3 id="never-split-the-difference-negotiating-as-if-your-life-depended-on-it"><a href="https://amzn.to/3eZ2vOp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Never Split the Difference<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It</span></a></h3><p>A former international hostage negotiator for the FBI offers a new, field-tested approach to high-stakes negotiations―whether in the boardroom or at home.</p><p>After a stint policing the rough streets of Kansas City, Missouri, Chris Voss joined the FBI, where his career as a hostage negotiator brought him face-to-face with a range of criminals, including bank robbers and terrorists. Reaching the pinnacle of his profession, he became the FBI’s lead international kidnapping negotiator. <em>Never Split __the Difference</em> takes you inside the world of high-stakes negotiations and into Voss’s head, revealing the skills that helped him and his colleagues succeed where it mattered most: saving lives. In this practical guide, he shares the nine effective principles―counterintuitive tactics and strategies―you too can use to become more persuasive in both your professional and personal life.</p><p>Life is a series of negotiations you should be prepared for: buying a car, negotiating a salary, buying a home, renegotiating rent, deliberating with your partner. Taking emotional intelligence and intuition to the next level, <em>Never Split the Difference</em> gives you the competitive edge in any discussion.</p><h3 id="title.a-spacing-none.a-text-normal"><a href="https://amzn.to/2BMsfiH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In</span></a></h3><p><strong>The key text on problem-solving negotiation-updated and revised</strong></p><p>Since its original publication nearly thirty years ago, <em>Getting to Yes</em> has helped millions of people learn a better way to negotiate. One of the primary business texts of the modern era, it is based on the work of the Harvard Negotiation Project, a group that deals with all levels of negotiation and conflict resolution.</p><p><em>Getting to Yes</em> offers a proven, step-by-step strategy for coming to mutually acceptable agreements in every sort of conflict.

That sounds something like this:</p><p><strong><em>Graduate from college, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks mocha lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, trust your life-savings to Wall Street, and one day, when you are oh, say, 65 years old, you can retire rich.</em></strong></p><p>Since you were old enough to hold a job, you’ve been hoodwinked to believe that wealth can be created by blindly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the housing market, the stock market, and the job market. This soul-sucking, dream-stealing dogma is “The Slowlane” – an impotent FINANCIAL GAMBLE that dubiously promises wealth in a wheelchair.</p><p>Accept the Slowlane as your financial roadmap and your financial future will blow carelessly asunder on a sailboat of HOPE: HOPE you can get a job and keep it, HOPE the stock market doesn’t tank, HOPE for a robust economy, HOPE, HOPE, and HOPE. Is HOPE really the centerpiece of your family’s financial plan?</p><p>Drive the Slowlane and you will find your life deteriorate into a miserable exhibition about what you cannot do, versus what you can. For those who don’t want a lifetime subscription to mediocrity, there is an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth capable of burning a trail to financial freedom faster than any road out there. And shockingly, this road has nothing to do with jobs, 401(k), mutual funds, or a lifestyle of miserly living and 190 square foot tiny houses. Just some of what you will learn:</p><ul><li>Why jobs, 401(k)s, mutual funds, and 40-years of mindless frugality will never make you rich young.<li>Why most entrepreneurs fail and how to immediately put the odds in your favor.<li>The real law of wealth: Leverage this and wealth has no choice but to be magnetized to you.<li>The leading cause of poorness: Change this and you change everything.<li>How the rich really get rich – and no, it has nothing to do with a paycheck or a 401K match.<li>The mathematics of wealth and how any “Joe Schmo” can tap into real wealth real fast.<li>Why the guru’s sacred deities – compound interest and indexed funds – are impotent wealth accelerators.<li>Why popular guru platitudes like “do what you love” and “follow your passion” will most likely keep you poor, not rich.<li>And 250+ more poverty busting distinctions…</ul><p>Demand more. Change lanes and find your explosive wealth accelerator. Hit the Fastlane, crack the code to wealth, and find out how to live rich for a lifetime.</p><h3 id="title.a-spacing-none.a-text-normal"><a href="https://amzn.to/2C8VWdx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life: Life-Changing Tools for Healthy Relationships</span></a></h3><p>2,000,000 COPIES SOLD WORLDWIDE • TRANSLATED IN MORE THAN 35 LANGUAGES</p><p><strong>What is _Violent _Communication?</strong></p><p><strong>If “violent” means acting in ways that result in hurt or harm, then much </strong><strong>of how we communicate</strong>—judging others, bullying, having racial bias, blaming, finger pointing, discriminating, speaking without listening, criticizing others or ourselves, name-calling, reacting when angry, using political rhetoric, being defensive or judging who’s “good/bad” or what’s “right/wrong” with people—<strong>could indeed be called “violent communication.”</strong><br /> <strong>What is _Nonviolent _Communication?</strong></p><p><strong>Nonviolent Communication is the integration of four things:</strong><br /> <em>**</em></p><ul><li><strong>Consciousness:</strong> a set of principles that support living a life of compassion, collaboration, courage, and authenticity&lt;7li&gt;<li><strong>Language:</strong> understanding how words contribute to connection or distance<li><strong>Communication:</strong> knowing how to ask for what we want, how to hear others even in disagreement, and how to move toward solutions that work for all<li><strong>Means of influence:</strong> sharing “power with others” rather than using “power over others”<li><strong>Nonviolent Communication serves our desire to do three things:</strong><li><strong>Increase our ability to live with choice, meaning, and connection</strong><li><strong>Connect empathically with self and others to have more satisfying</strong> <strong>relationships</strong><li><strong>Sharing of resources so everyone is able to benefit</strong></ul><div class="col-12 col-sm-10 aligncenter"> <a href="/assets/img/posts/2020/07/IT-Books-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/posts/2020/07/IT-Books-scaled.jpg" alt="IT Books" /></a><p> IT Books</p></div></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/miscellaneous/'>Miscellaneous</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/books/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >Books</a> <a href="/tags/learning/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >Learning</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=IT Books you should read -
