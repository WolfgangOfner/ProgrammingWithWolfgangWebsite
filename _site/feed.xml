Doing so enables you to manage the cluster from Azure with tools such as Azure Monitor or Cloud Defender. Today, I want to show you how to install the Container Insights Extension which enables you to monitor your pods and nodes from the on-premise cluster in Azure.

The installation was done directly on the Master node of the cluster and developers would also need to connect to the master node to execute any commands on the Kubernetes cluster. Today, I want to show you how to give developers access using RBAC (Role-based access control) and let them connect to th... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Install Azure Arc on an On-premises k3s Cluster</title><link href="/install-azure-arc-on-premises-k3s-cluster/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Install Azure Arc on an On-premises k3s Cluster" /><published>2022-05-30T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-05-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>/install-azure-arc-on-premises-k3s-cluster/</id> <content src="/install-azure-arc-on-premises-k3s-cluster/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <category term="Cloud" /> <summary> In my last post, I have created an on-premises k3s cluster and introduced the requirements of this project. One of the requirements/restraints of this project is that the k3s cluster sits behind a firewall that blocks all incoming traffic. Today, I will show you how to install Azure Arc which will help to manage the cluster with Azure, even though it is not accessible over the internet.

This doesn’t mean that I have been lazy though. First, it was nice to take a step back and take care of my (mental) health. and then I talked at a conference in Germany about KEDA. It was nice to travel and especially be at an in-person conference. It’s been quite some time since the last time. I also started to write r... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Azure Arc Series - Manage an on-premises Kubernetes Cluster with Azure Arc</title><link href="/manage-on-premises-kubernetes-with-azure-arc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Azure Arc Series - Manage an on-premises Kubernetes Cluster with Azure Arc" /><published>2022-02-21T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-02-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>/manage-on-premises-kubernetes-with-azure-arc/</id> <content src="/manage-on-premises-kubernetes-with-azure-arc/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <summary> Azure Arc is a great tool to manage your on-premises hardware with Azure. This series will focus on managing a Kubernetes (k3s) cluster and will show how to install Azure Arc, and how to use different Azure services to manage the cluster. Project Requirements and Restrictions The project for this demo has the following requirements and restrictions: Two on-premises Ubuntu 20.04 VMs Inst... </summary> </entry> </feed>
