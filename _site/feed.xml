I am excited to travel to Germany and speak at the BASTA! conference in Frankfurt about KEDA. You can join the session in-person, or remote to learn more about KEDA. If you can’t make it to the conference but still want to learn more about KEDA, see KEDA - Kube... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Introducing Kubernetes Services</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/introducing-kubernetes-services/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing Kubernetes Services" /><published>2022-01-31T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-01-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/introducing-kubernetes-services/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/introducing-kubernetes-services/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <summary> Pods can be deleted and recreated at any time, making them a so-called nonpermanent resource in Kubernetes. Therefore, the IP address of a pod will likely change regularly. This behavior will cause problems when you have a resource, for example, a DNS record, pointing to your application. It will be impossible to route to the application since the IP address of the pods will always change.

Currently, I am working on a .NET 6 console application and this showed me that especially ASP.NET MVC makes it easy to set up middleware such as dependency injection. When using a console application, it is not hard but it requires a bit more work than the web application. In this post, I would like to show you how to use .NET secrets in y... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Create Git Commits in an Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/create-git-commits-in-azure-devops-yaml-pipeline/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Create Git Commits in an Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline" /><published>2021-12-20T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-12-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/create-git-commits-in-azure-devops-yaml-pipeline/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/create-git-commits-in-azure-devops-yaml-pipeline/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="DevOps" /> <summary> This week I encountered the need to commit some code to a Git repository in an Azure DevOps pipeline. First, I had no idea how to could work because the repository has some branch policies and require the committer to create a pull request. As it turns out, if you configure your pipeline with the right permissions, committing code in the pipeline is quite simple. Configure the Pipeline to byp... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Azure Arc - Getting Started</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/azure-arc-getting-started/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Azure Arc - Getting Started" /><published>2021-12-13T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-12-16T22:44:28+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/azure-arc-getting-started/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/azure-arc-getting-started/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Cloud" /> <summary> Today, many companies use cloud services, but there is also still a sizeable group of companies that can’t use cloud services for various reasons.

This is where Azure Arc comes into play to help you administer your on-premise, or multi-cloud applications and a... </summary> </entry> </feed>
