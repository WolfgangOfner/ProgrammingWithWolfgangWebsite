You would like to know how many errors occur, how long the response times of your services are, and also how many people are even using your application. In my last post, I added Grafana Loki to log events but it also installed Prometheus which I will use in this post to log messages from my microservices in my ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Collect and Query your Kubernetes Cluster Logs with Grafana Loki</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/collect-and-query-kubernetes-logs-with-grafana-loki/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Collect and Query your Kubernetes Cluster Logs with Grafana Loki" /><published>2021-07-19T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-07-24T14:26:20+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/collect-and-query-kubernetes-logs-with-grafana-loki/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/collect-and-query-kubernetes-logs-with-grafana-loki/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <category term="Cloud" /> <summary> So far I have talked about the development, deployment, and configuration of microservices and Kubernetes in this series. Over the next couple of posts, I want to talk about an essential topic when it comes to running your services in production: logging and monitoring. In this post, I will show you how to install the Grafana Loki stack and how you can query the logs of everything inside a Kub... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Debug Microservices running inside a Kubernetes Cluster with Bridge to Kubernetes</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/debug-microservices-bridge-kubernetes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Debug Microservices running inside a Kubernetes Cluster with Bridge to Kubernetes" /><published>2021-07-12T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-07-12T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/debug-microservices-bridge-kubernetes/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/debug-microservices-bridge-kubernetes/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <category term="Cloud" /> <summary> Kubernetes and new tools and technologies, in general, are great to build new products and applications. An important aspect of using them is how easy it is to find and fix problems. Tracing and debugging a microservice architecture can be quite hard and is perhaps the biggest downside of it. Microsoft allows developers to route traffic from a Kubernetes cluster to their local environment to d... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Fixing NuGet.targets(131,5) error The local source doesn't exist.</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/nuget-targets-local-source-does-not-exist/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fixing NuGet.targets(131,5) error The local source doesn't exist." /><published>2021-07-05T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-07-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/nuget-targets-local-source-does-not-exist/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/nuget-targets-local-source-does-not-exist/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Miscellaneous" /> <summary> Today, I was trying to add a new NuGet package to my .NET 5 project and I got the following error message: C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\5.0.301\NuGet.targets(131,5): error : The local source ‘C:\Users\Wolfgang\Desktop\poc-microservice-main\ProductService\ProductService.Catalog’ doesn’t exist.

Often it took several weeks and then there was still something missing or the wrong version of the needed software installed. This was one of my biggest pet peeves and it was a major reason why I left my first job. Fortunately, we have a solution to these pains, Infrastructure as Code.
