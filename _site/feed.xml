One of the requirements/restraints of this project is that the k3s cluster sits behind a firewall that blocks all incoming traffic. Today, I will show you how to install Azure Arc which will help to manage the cluster with Azure, even though it is not accessible over the internet.

This doesn’t mean that I have been lazy though. First, it was nice to take a step back and take care of my (mental) health. and then I talked at a conference in Germany about KEDA. It was nice to travel and especially be at an in-person conference. It’s been quite some time since the last time. I also started to write r... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Azure Arc Series - Manage an on-premises Kubernetes Cluster with Azure Arc</title><link href="/manage-on-premises-kubernetes-with-azure-arc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Azure Arc Series - Manage an on-premises Kubernetes Cluster with Azure Arc" /><published>2022-02-21T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-05-29T17:19:22+02:00</updated> <id>/manage-on-premises-kubernetes-with-azure-arc/</id> <content src="/manage-on-premises-kubernetes-with-azure-arc/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <summary> Azure Arc is a great tool to manage your on-premises hardware with Azure. This series will focus on managing a Kubernetes (k3s) cluster and will show how to install Azure Arc, and how to use different Azure services to manage the cluster. Project Requirements and Restrictions The project for this demo has the following requirements and restrictions: Two on-premises Ubuntu 20.04 VMs Inst... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Install an on-premises k3s Cluster</title><link href="/install-on-premises-k3s-cluster/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Install an on-premises k3s Cluster" /><published>2022-02-14T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-05-26T16:27:22+02:00</updated> <id>/install-on-premises-k3s-cluster/</id> <content src="/install-on-premises-k3s-cluster/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <summary> Using cloud technologies is amazing and makes a developer’s life so much easier. Lately, I have to work with an on-premises Kubernetes cluster and I had to realize how much work it is to do all these things cloud providers offer. That’s the reason why I got into Azure Arc. In my last post, Azure Arc - Getting Started, I explained what Azure Arc is and how it can be used to manage on-premises re... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Speaking about KEDA at the BASTA!

I am excited to travel to Germany and speak at the BASTA! conference in Frankfurt about KEDA. You can join the session in-person, or remote to learn more about KEDA. If you can’t make it to the conference but still want to learn more about KEDA, see KEDA - Kube... </summary> </entry> </feed>
