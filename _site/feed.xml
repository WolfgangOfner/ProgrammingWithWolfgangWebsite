The post was only theoretical and was probably a bit abstract if you have never worked with a service mesh. Therefore, I want to show you how to install Istio and a sample application on your Kubernetes cluster in this post. This p... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Service Mesh in Kubernetes - Getting Started</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/service-mesh-kubernetes-getting-started/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Service Mesh in Kubernetes - Getting Started" /><published>2021-08-09T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-08-09T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/service-mesh-kubernetes-getting-started/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/service-mesh-kubernetes-getting-started/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <category term="Cloud" /> <summary> If you have followed this series then you have learned what microservices are, how to program and deploy them, and how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster and applications. The last missing puzzle piece in your microservice journey is how to manage applications with hundreds or thousands of pods and microservices. This is where a service mesh comes into play. This post will talk about the pro a... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Create Grafana Dashboards with Prometheus Metrics</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/create-grafana-dashboards-with-prometheus-metrics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Create Grafana Dashboards with Prometheus Metrics" /><published>2021-08-02T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-08-02T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/create-grafana-dashboards-with-prometheus-metrics/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/create-grafana-dashboards-with-prometheus-metrics/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <category term="Cloud" /> <summary> In my last post, I added the Prometheus client library to my .NET microservices. This was the first step to implement monitoring of the microservices which are running in a Kubernetes cluster. In this post, I will show you how to create your first dashboard with Grafana using the Prometheus data. This post is part of “Microservice Series - From Zero to Hero”. Add the Microservices to the Pro... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Monitor .NET Microservices in Kubernetes with Prometheus</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/monitor-net-microservices-with-prometheus/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Monitor .NET Microservices in Kubernetes with Prometheus" /><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-07-26T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/monitor-net-microservices-with-prometheus/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/monitor-net-microservices-with-prometheus/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <category term="Cloud" /> <summary> Knowledge is power is a famous saying which also holds true when running software. You would like to know how many errors occur, how long the response times of your services are, and also how many people are even using your application. In my last post, I added Grafana Loki to log events but it also installed Prometheus which I will use in this post to log messages from my microservices in my ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Collect and Query your Kubernetes Cluster Logs with Grafana Loki</title><link href="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/collect-and-query-kubernetes-logs-with-grafana-loki/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Collect and Query your Kubernetes Cluster Logs with Grafana Loki" /><published>2021-07-19T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-07-26T09:16:55+02:00</updated> <id>https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/collect-and-query-kubernetes-logs-with-grafana-loki/</id> <content src="https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/collect-and-query-kubernetes-logs-with-grafana-loki/" /> <author> <name>Wolfgang Ofner</name> </author> <category term="Kubernetes" /> <category term="Cloud" /> <summary> So far I have talked about the development, deployment, and configuration of microservices and Kubernetes in this series. Over the next couple of posts, I want to talk about an essential topic when it comes to running your services in production: logging and monitoring. In this post, I will show you how to install the Grafana Loki stack and how you can query the logs of everything inside a Kub... </summary> </entry> </feed>
