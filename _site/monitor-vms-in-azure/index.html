For example, you could enter Usage and click the Search icon which will give you various information about the usage of your VM. Search the logs for the usage of your VM Monitor your network topology After you deployed your Network Watcher, you can look at the topology of your network by following these steps: Click on Topology under the Monitoring menu. On the Topology blade select your Subscription, Resource group, and Virtual Network. Your network will be displayed you can download it by clicking on Download topology Monitor your network To monitor and diagnose your network, Azure has a service called Network Watcher. The Network Watcher can visualize your network and therefore can help you to understand, diagnose and gain insights into your network in Azure. Following, I will talk about some features of the Network Watcher. Create a Network Watcher To enable a Network Watcher follow these steps: In the Azure Portal, click on All services and search for Network Watcher and select the result. On the Overview blade of your Network Watcher, enable the regions you want to monitor in the drop-down list. Enable Network Watchers in your desired location Monitor the topology of your network After your Network Watcher is deployed, you can take a look at the topology of your network. To do that follow these steps: In your Network Watcher, click on Topology under the Monitoring menu. On the Topology blade, select a Subscription, Resource Group, and a Virtual Network. After a couple of seconds, your network will be displayed. You can also download the topology by clicking on Download topology. Topology with virtual machines and network cards Monitor your network limits You can only have a certain amount of network resources per subscription. The Network Watcher lists all used resources and makes it easy to monitor them. To do that follow these steps: In your Network Watcher, click on Network subscription limit. Select a Subscription and Location. The Portal will list all resources, the current limit, and your usage. Overview of the Network subscription limit Conclusion In this post, I showed how to enable monitoring and diagnostics when deploying a new VM as well as for an existing VM. The next section talked about Application Insights and how to monitor WebApps and also application running on IIS on a VM. Next, I showed how to monitor your VMs with Log Analytics and how to filter these logs. The last part was a short overview of the Network Watcher and how to monitor your network with it.

Provide a name, Subscription, Resource Group, Location, and Pricing tier, then click OK. Create a new Log Analytics instance Enable the Log Analytics VM Extension After Log Analytics is created, you have to enable the Log Analytics VM Extension. The extension gets installed automatically and configures the agent to send data to the Log Analytics automatically. To set enable the Log Analytics VM Extension follow these steps: Go to your Log Analytics in the Azure Portal. Select Virtual machines under the Workspace Data Sources menu and select the VM you want to install the agent on. On the Virtual machine blade, click on Connect. This installs the agent and configures it for your Log Analytics workspace. After the installation is completed, the OMS connection status will change to This workspace. Installing the agent on your VM Collect event and performance data Log Analytics can collect events from the Windows event logs or Linux Syslog and performance and also take action when a particular condition is detected. To set it up, follow these steps: Go to Log Analytics in the Azure Portal. Select Advanced settings under the Settings menu. Select Data and then select Windows Event Logs. Add a new event log by entering a name and then clicking +. After the log is created, select the desired log level. Create a new Log for information from your VM Select Windows Performance Counters and enable your desired performance counters. Select your desired performance counters Click Save. View the collected data After data collection is set up, you can run searches in your log. To do that, follow these steps: Open your Log Analytics in the Azure Portal. Click Log Search under the General menu. The Log Search blade already suggests a couple of queries and the search box also makes suggestions based on your input. For example, you could enter Usage and click the Search icon which will give you various information about the usage of your VM. Search the logs for the usage of your VM Monitor your network topology After you deployed your Network Watcher, you can look at the topology of your network by following these steps: Click on Topology under the Monitoring menu. On the Topology blade select your Subscription, Resource group, and Virtual Network. Your network will be displayed you can download it by clicking on Download topology Monitor your network To monitor and diagnose your network, Azure has a service called Network Watcher. The Network Watcher can visualize your network and therefore can help you to understand, diagnose and gain insights into your network in Azure. Following, I will talk about some features of the Network Watcher. Create a Network Watcher To enable a Network Watcher follow these steps: In the Azure Portal, click on All services and search for Network Watcher and select the result. On the Overview blade of your Network Watcher, enable the regions you want to monitor in the drop-down list. Enable Network Watchers in your desired location Monitor the topology of your network After your Network Watcher is deployed, you can take a look at the topology of your network. To do that follow these steps: In your Network Watcher, click on Topology under the Monitoring menu. On the Topology blade, select a Subscription, Resource Group, and a Virtual Network. After a couple of seconds, your network will be displayed. You can also download the topology by clicking on Download topology. Topology with virtual machines and network cards Monitor your network limits You can only have a certain amount of network resources per subscription. The Network Watcher lists all used resources and makes it easy to monitor them. To do that follow these steps: In your Network Watcher, click on Network subscription limit. Select a Subscription and Location. The Portal will list all resources, the current limit, and your usage. Overview of the Network subscription limit Conclusion In this post, I showed how to enable monitoring and diagnostics when deploying a new VM as well as for an existing VM. The next section talked about Application Insights and how to monitor WebApps and also application running on IIS on a VM. Next, I showed how to monitor your VMs with Log Analytics and how to filter these logs. The last part was a short overview of the Network Watcher and how to monitor your network with it.

Monitoring helps you to gain insight into the status of the VMs.</p><p>Windows and Linux VMs collect the following metrics out of the box:</p><ul><li>CPU percentage<li>Disk read and write in KB/s or MB/s<li>Network in and out in KB/s or MB/s</ul><p>On Windows, the Azure Virtual Machine Agent installs the IaaSDiagnostics extension which monitors and collects diagnostic data. On Linux the Microsoft.Insights.VMDaignsticsSettings extension provides the same function.</p><p>The metrics collected on a Linux VM are:</p><ul><li>CPU<li>Disk<li>Memory<li>Network<li>Packets<li>Page<li>Swap</ul><p>The metrics collected on a Windows VM are:</p><ul><li>CPU<li>Disk<li>Network<li>Memory<li>ASP.NET<li>SQL Server</ul><p>These metrics are stored in Azure Storage Tables. By default, all metrics are collected every minute as a new row in the table.</p><p><span class="fontstyle0">For Windows VMs, metric data is written to the WADPerformanceCountersTable, with aggregates of these performance counter metrics aggregated to the minute or to the hour written to tables that start with the name WADMetricsPT1M for by minute and WADMetricsPT1H for by hour.  In addition to metrics, system logs are also collected. For Linux VM’s, the Syslog is collected into the LinuxsyslogVer2v0 table. For Windows VMs, all event log entries for the three event logs (application, security and system logs) are written to the WADWindowsEventLogsTable.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">Windows VMs can collect other types of logs. Diagnostic infrastructure logs (events generated by the Azure Diagnostic Agent, such as issues collecting metrics) are written to the WADDiagnosticInfrastructureLogsTable, and application logs (the trace output from your .NET  application running in the VM) are stored in the WADLogsTable. Windows VMs can also collect Event Tracing for Windows Events. These events are collected into the WADETWEventTable.
