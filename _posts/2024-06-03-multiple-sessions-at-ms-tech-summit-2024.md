I'm excited to announce that I will be speaking at MS Tech Summit 2024 in Warsaw, Poland on June 6, 2024. Join me online as I present a session titled: "Scaling to Success: Leveraging KEDA and Kubernetes for Optimal Performance."

During our time together, we will explore the practical application of KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling) to efficiently scale Azure DevOps pipeline agents within a Kubernetes cluster. Discover the tremendous benefits that come with leveraging KEDA, including automatic scaling based on workload, which can significantly enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your pipeline operations.

I am thrilled to provide a live demonstration, guiding you through the setup and configuration of KEDA with Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes environment. By attending this session, you will gain invaluable insights into the best practices for optimizing your pipeline operations using KEDA and leveraging the scalability of Kubernetes.

Don't miss out on this fantastic opportunity to expand your knowledge and elevate your DevOps operations. Get ready to scale your DevOps operations to new heights with KEDA and Kubernetes at the MS Tech Summit conference.

Additionally, I will present my sessions "Unleashing the Potential of Hybrid Cloud: Multi-Cloud Management and On-Premises Integration" and "Bring DevOps to the Swiss Alps" as online VODs.

You can find all sessions on the <a href="https://mstechsummit.pl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conference's website</a>.

The abstract of the three sessions is as follows:

## Scaling to Success: Leveraging KEDA and Kubernetes for Optimal Performance

In this talk, we will discuss the use of KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) to scale Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes cluster. 

We will cover the benefits of using KEDA, such as automatic scaling based on workload, and how it can improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your pipeline. There will also be a demonstration of how to set up and configure KEDA with Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes cluster. 

Attendees will learn best practices for using KEDA to optimize their pipeline and gain a deeper understanding of how to leverage Kubernetes for scaling their DevOps operations.

## Bring DevOps to the Swiss Alps

Many companies use cloud services for their projects nowadays. These companies leverage the seemingly endless scalability and the elastic pricing model of the cloud. Nevertheless, many projects still cannot use cloud services for various reasons. These may encompass regulatory restrictions, data protection, or just having an existing on-premises infrastructure. 

While these are all valid causes, why not combine an existing on-premises infrastructure with the power of the cloud? This is where Azure Arc comes into play. Azure Arc allows to project on-premises infrastructure into Azure and then apply Azure services like Azure Monitor or Azure Policy on the on-premises infrastructure.

This session shows how a Swiss company uses Azure Arc to manage an on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Using Azure Arc enables the development team to leverage the power of the cloud and provide a streamlined DevOps process. All this can be achieved without the cluster being accessible from the internet.

## Unleashing the Potential of Hybrid Cloud: Multi-Cloud Management and On-Premises Integration

Get ready to revolutionize your hybrid cloud strategy! 

In this session, we will take a deep dive into how Microsoft Azure technologies can bring the best of both worlds - on-premises and the cloud - to your organization. We'll focus on how Azure Arc and Kubernetes can help you easily manage and secure your multi-cloud environment, while also bringing Azure services to your own hardware. 

You'll learn about the key features and capabilities of these technologies, and see real-world examples of how they can be used to optimize workloads, improve compliance, and drive innovation. It's time to take your hybrid cloud to the next level!
