description: Learn how the AKS Flux GitOps extension allows you to easily implement GitOps on your Azure Kubernetes Service clusters, enabling automated and declarative deployments straight from your Git repositories.

This post examines the AKS GitOps extension for Flux, a tool designed to automate deployments to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) by leveraging Git as the source of truth. We'll explore the core concepts of GitOps, how the Flux extension works, and provide a practical demonstration of its capabilities. We'll also address some of the speaker's reservations about the extension's usability.

## Understanding GitOps

GitOps is a powerful approach to managing Kubernetes infrastructure and applications. It works by using a Git repository as the single source of truth for the desired state of your cluster. An agent running within the cluster continuously monitors this repository. When changes are made to the repository (e.g., updating application versions, scaling deployments), the agent automatically pulls these changes and applies them to the cluster.

This "pull-based" approach offers significant advantages:

- **Enhanced Security:** By allowing you to lock down your Kubernetes cluster, as external access isn't needed for deployments. Connections are initiated from inside the cluster, going through the firewall as outgoing connections.
- **Drift Detection:** The GitOps operator actively monitors for configuration changes within the cluster. If the cluster's state deviates from the Git repository, it automatically reapplies the correct configuration, ensuring consistency.

The two major open-source solutions for GitOps are Flux CD and Argo CD. This post focuses on the AKS Flux extension, a Microsoft-flavored implementation of Flux CD.

## How the Flux Extension Works

The typical workflow involves a developer creating a pull request to an application repository. This triggers CI/CD pipelines. The CI pipeline builds and tests the application, creating a container image and pushing it to a container registry. The CD pipeline then modifies the configuration within a separate Git repository â€“ the GitOps repository.

The Flux agent, running inside the AKS cluster, periodically checks this GitOps repository (by default, every 10 minutes, though this is configurable). When it detects changes, the Flux operator downloads and applies the new configurations, deploying the application to the cluster. This automated process avoids the need for manual deployments and ensures consistency between the Git repository and the cluster's actual state.

## Practical Demonstration

The video demonstrates the following key steps:

- **Setup:** Installing necessary Azure CLI extensions (k8s-configuration and k8s-extension) and registering service providers for the subscription.
- **AKS Cluster Creation:** Creating a basic AKS cluster.
- **Flux Extension Deployment**: Deploying the Flux extension using az k8s-configuration flux create, configuring parameters like the Git repository URL, branch, and sync interval.
- **Customization Files:** Using a kustomization.yaml file to define the resources to be deployed.
- **Automated Updates:** Demonstrating how changes to the Git repository (e.g., scaling the application) are automatically applied to the cluster.
- **Dependencies and Namespaces:** Managing deployment order by defining dependencies between resources.

## A Critical Perspective

The speaker expresses some reservations about the AKS Flux extension, noting that it hasn't significantly improved over the past four years. They highlight challenges with Helm chart deployments and suggest that directly installing Flux might offer a better experience. The speaker also notes that they found the documentation to be lacking and confusing.

However, the speaker emphasizes that GitOps is a valuable approach for managing Kubernetes clusters. They also express excitement about the Argo CD extension, which they found more user-friendly.

## Conclusion

While the AKS Flux extension may have some usability challenges, the underlying principles of GitOps offer a robust and secure way to manage Kubernetes deployments. It's important to weigh the benefits of GitOps against the specific implementation details of the chosen tool. The speaker's experiences highlight the importance of considering alternative GitOps solutions, such as Argo CD, when evaluating your options.
