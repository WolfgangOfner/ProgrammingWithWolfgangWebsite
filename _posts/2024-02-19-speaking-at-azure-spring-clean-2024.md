I'm excited to be speaking at the Azure Spring Clean 2024. My session, titled "Bring DevOps to the Swiss Alps", and will be presented in a special way. 

The session will be posted as an article on my website between March 4 and 8 and then there will be a live Q&A about the article. The schedule for this is yet to be released.

In my session, I will showcase how a Swiss company used Azure Arc to manage an on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Using Azure Arc not only enables the development team to leverage the power of the cloud but also provides a streamlined deployment process using GitOps. All this can be achieved without the cluster being accessible from the internet.

Donâ€™t miss this opportunity to gain insights into how you can harness the power of the cloud while maintaining your on-premises infrastructure.

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## Bring DevOps to the Swiss Alps

Many companies leverage the seemingly endless scalability and the elastic pricing model of the cloud already. Nevertheless, many projects still cannot use cloud services for various reasons. These may encompass regulatory restrictions, data protection, or just having an existing on-premises infrastructure.   

While these are all valid causes, why not combine an existing on-premises infrastructure with the power of the cloud?  

This session shows how a Swiss company used Azure Arc to manage an on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Using Azure Arc enables the development team to leverage the power of the cloud and provides a streamlined deployment process using GitOps. All this can be achieved without the cluster being accessible from the internet.
