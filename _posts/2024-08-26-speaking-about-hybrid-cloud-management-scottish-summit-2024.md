Exciting news! I will be speaking in-person at the Scottish Summit 2024. My session, titled "Unleashing the Potential of Hybrid Cloud: Multi-Cloud Management" will explore how companies can effectively combine their existing on-premises infrastructure with the power of the cloud. This will be my first time traveling to Scotland, and I am looking forward to the experience!

In today's digital age, many companies leverage cloud services for their scalability and flexible pricing. However, some projects still rely on on-premises infrastructure due to regulatory restrictions, data protection, or existing investments. This session will demonstrate how Azure Arc can bridge this gap by projecting on-premises infrastructure into Azure, allowing the application of Azure services like Azure Monitor and Azure Policy.

We will delve into a real-world example of a Swiss company using Azure Arc to manage an on-premises Kubernetes cluster, showcasing how this integration streamlines DevOps processes and leverages cloud capabilities without exposing the cluster to the internet.

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## Unleashing the Potential of Hybrid Cloud: Multi-Cloud Management

Most companies use cloud services for their projects nowadays. These companies leverage the seemingly endless scalability and the elastic pricing model of the cloud. Nevertheless, many projects still cannot use cloud services for various reasons. These may encompass regulatory restrictions, data protection, or just having an existing on-premises infrastructure. 

While these are all valid causes, why not combine an existing on-premises infrastructure with the power of the cloud? This is where Azure Arc comes into play. Azure Arc allows to project on-premises infrastructure into Azure and then apply Azure services like Azure Monitor or Azure Policy on the on-premises infrastructure.

This session shows how a Swiss company uses Azure Arc to manage an on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Using Azure Arc enables the development team to leverage the power of the cloud and provide a streamlined DevOps process. All this can be achieved without the cluster being accessible from the internet.
