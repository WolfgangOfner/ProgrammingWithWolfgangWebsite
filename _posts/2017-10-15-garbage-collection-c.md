The garbage collection is a great feature which makes the life of a programmer was easier. It releases unused variables and doing so frees memory on the heap.  If you know C++ or C, you know what a pain it can be to release all unused object and variables and how easily you can forget one which will lead to a memory leak. A memory leak is caused by a variable which has a value but no reference. This means that the variable can&#8217;t be deleted and remains in the memory until the computer is restarted.

In C# the garbage collection works fully automatically and the programmer doesn&#8217;t have to worry about it. But how does it work?

## Garbage Collection and variable generations

When a new variable is generated it will be placed in generation 0. The garbage collector is invoked after the generation 0 filled up. The unused variable will be deleted and the memory will be released from the heap. Variables which survive this process will be pushed into generation 1. If generation 1 is full the process will be repeated. C# knows the generations 0, 1, 2. Lower generations will be checked more frequently.

The programmer can&#8217;t start the garbage collection process. Going through all variables is an expensive task and comes with the cost of lower performance.
