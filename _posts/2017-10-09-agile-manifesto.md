The Agile Manifesto is a guideline how to collaborate in agile projects. The goal is to achieve better results by working together.

The Agile Manifesto defines four main rules on how to work together in a project:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools<br /> <strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation<br /> <strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation<br /> <strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan
</p>

&nbsp;

**Individuals and interactions:** Talking to each other and meeting a colleagues or customers needs is more important than insisting on certain processes or tools.

**Working software:** The main goal is to have a working software. This must be the focus. A great documentation is nice but if the code is self-explaining, then the documentation is not that important anymore (a user documentation might be needed though). See Clean Code

**Customer collaboration:** Work together with your customer and try to meet his or her wishes. This leads to a way better result and a more satisfied customer than negotiating every little detail in a contract.

**Responding to change**: Requirements change all the time. Try to adapt to the changes. This leads to a better software and higher customer satisfaction.

The Agile Manifesto also defines <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twelve Principles of Agile Software </a>which can be found on their website.
