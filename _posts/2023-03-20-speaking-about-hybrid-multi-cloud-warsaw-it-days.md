I am thrilled to announce my second session at Warsaw IT Days 2023, titled "Unleashing the Potential of Hybrid Cloud: Streamlining Multi-Cloud Management and On-Premises Integration"

During this session, we'll dive deep into how Microsoft Azure technologies can revolutionize your hybrid cloud strategy. We'll focus on how Azure Arc and Kubernetes can help you easily manage and secure your multi-cloud environment, while also bringing Azure services to your own hardware.

You'll learn about the key features and capabilities of these technologies, and see real-world examples of how they can be used to optimize workloads, improve compliance, and drive innovation. It's time to take your hybrid cloud to the next level!

Don't miss out on this opportunity to streamline your multi-cloud management and on-premises integration. Register now for the <a href="https://warszawskiedniinformatyki.pl/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warsaw IT Days 2023</a>, and join me for this exciting online session on March 31, 2023!

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## Unleashing the Potential of Hybrid Cloud: Streamlining Multi-Cloud Management and On-Premises Integration  

Most companies use cloud services for their projects nowadays. These companies leverage the seemingly endless scalability and the elastic pricing model of the cloud. Nevertheless, many projects still cannot use cloud services for various reasons. These may encompass regulatory restrictions, data protection, or just having an existing on-premises infrastructure. 

While these are all valid causes, why not combine an existing on-premises infrastructure with the power of the cloud? This is where Azure Arc comes into play. Azure Arc allows to project on-premises infrastructure into Azure and then apply Azure services like Azure Monitor or Azure Policy on the on-premises infrastructure.

This session shows how a Swiss company uses Azure Arc to manage an on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Using Azure Arc enables the development team to leverage the power of the cloud and provide a streamlined DevOps process. All this can be achieved without the cluster being accessible from the internet.
