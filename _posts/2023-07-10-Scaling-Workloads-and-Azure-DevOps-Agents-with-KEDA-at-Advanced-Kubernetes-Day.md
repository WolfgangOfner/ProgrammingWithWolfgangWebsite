I'm excited to announce that I will be speaking at the upcoming "Advanced Kubernetes Day" event on July 11, 2023. Join me online as I present a session titled: "Scaling to Success: Leveraging KEDA and Kubernetes for Optimal Performance."

During our time together, we will explore the practical application of KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling) to efficiently scale Azure DevOps pipeline agents within a Kubernetes cluster. Discover the tremendous benefits that come with leveraging KEDA, including automatic scaling based on workload, which can significantly enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your pipeline operations.

I am thrilled to provide a live demonstration, guiding you through the setup and configuration of KEDA with Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes environment. By attending this session, you will gain invaluable insights into the best practices for optimizing your pipeline operations using KEDA and leveraging the scalability of Kubernetes.

Don't miss out on this fantastic opportunity to expand your knowledge and elevate your DevOps operations. Mark your calendars for July 11, 2023, and stay tuned for further updates on the event schedule and session details. Get ready to scale your DevOps operations to new heights with KEDA and Kubernetes at the "Advanced Kubernetes Day" event!

The abstract of the session is as follows:

## Scaling to Success: Leveraging KEDA and Kubernetes for Optimal Performance

In this talk, we will discuss the use of KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling) to scale Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes cluster.

We will cover the benefits of using KEDA, such as automatic scaling based on workload, and how it can improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your pipeline. There will also be a demonstration of how to set up and configure KEDA with Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes cluster.

Attendees will learn best practices for using KEDA to optimize their pipeline and gain a deeper understanding of how to leverage Kubernetes for scaling their DevOps operations.
