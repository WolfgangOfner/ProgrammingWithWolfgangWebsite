This post explores Azure Linux, Microsoft's custom-built operating system, explaining why it is becoming a preferred choice for Azure services, particularly for enhancing security within Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environments.

## What is Azure Linux?

Azure Linux is an operating system developed by Microsoft from the ground up, distinct from existing Linux distributions. It is an RPM-based system already powering many of Microsoft's own first-party Azure services, including critical infrastructure like Microsoft Defender and Xbox Live. 

The project is open-source, with its code readily available on GitHub. While it is possible to run it as a standalone virtual machine, its core design and primary purpose are centered around seamless integration with Azure services, offering optimized performance and security within Microsoft's cloud ecosystem.

## Key Advantages of Azure Linux

Azure Linux offers several compelling advantages that make it an attractive option for cloud deployments. A significant benefit comes from Microsoft's direct control over every aspect of Azure Linux's development. 

### This unified management ensures:

- **Enhanced Security**: Dedicated internal teams can rapidly identify and patch security vulnerabilities, providing quicker responses to potential threats.
- **Optimized Performance**: Specialized teams are focused on resolving performance issues swiftly, ensuring Azure services run efficiently.
- **Consistent Quality**: A single company's oversight throughout the development lifecycle aims for a higher standard of quality and reliability.
- **Streamlined Support**: Centralized support simplifies the troubleshooting process for any issues that may arise, offering a more direct path to resolution.
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Azure Linux is meticulously built for its role within Azure. This means it includes only the essential packages required to run Azure services. 

### This minimalist approach inherently leads to:

- **Fewer Vulnerabilities**: With fewer components, there are fewer potential targets for attacks, significantly reducing the system's attack surface.
- **Greater Stability**: A smaller footprint also translates to a lower number of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and a reduced need for frequent patches, contributing to a more stable environment.
- **Enhanced Performance**: The minimal package count directly contributes to a smaller image size, which in turn boosts performance. 

### For AKS clusters, this translates into tangible benefits:

- **Faster Cluster Creation**: Users can experience quicker cluster provisioning times compared to traditional operating systems like Ubuntu or Windows.
- **Reliable Performance**: Updates undergo rigorous testing to ensure that no performance regressions occur, providing a consistent and high-performing experience for AKS workloads.

## Azure Linux with AKS

Azure Linux is a fundamental component of AKS. It serves as the default operating system for the control plane in AKS clusters. 

For new AKS clusters, integrating Azure Linux is straightforward; it can be selected when creating a node pool, just as with other operating system options. Azure Linux 3 currently supports Kubernetes versions 1.31 and above, while earlier AKS versions continue to utilize Azure Linux 2.

## Conclusion

Azure Linux provides a more secure and efficient cluster experience. Its purpose-built design, direct management by Microsoft, inherent security advantages from a reduced attack surface, and improved performance collectively contribute to a robust solution. For those running AKS, Azure Linux offers a compelling path to optimize your environment.
