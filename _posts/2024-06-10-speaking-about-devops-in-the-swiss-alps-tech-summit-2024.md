I'm excited to announce that I will be speaking at MS Tech Summit 2024 in Warsaw, Poland on June 6, 2024. Join me online as I present a session titled: "Scaling to Success: Leveraging KEDA and Kubernetes for Optimal Performance."

Additionally, I will present my session "Bring DevOps to the Swiss Alps" as online VODs.

You can find all sessions on the <a href="https://mstechsummit.pl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conference's website</a>.

The abstract of the three sessions is as follows:

## Bring DevOps to the Swiss Alps

Many companies use cloud services for their projects nowadays. These companies leverage the seemingly endless scalability and the elastic pricing model of the cloud. Nevertheless, many projects still cannot use cloud services for various reasons. These may encompass regulatory restrictions, data protection, or just having an existing on-premises infrastructure. 

While these are all valid causes, why not combine an existing on-premises infrastructure with the power of the cloud? This is where Azure Arc comes into play. Azure Arc allows to project on-premises infrastructure into Azure and then apply Azure services like Azure Monitor or Azure Policy on the on-premises infrastructure.

This session shows how a Swiss company uses Azure Arc to manage an on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Using Azure Arc enables the development team to leverage the power of the cloud and provide a streamlined DevOps process. All this can be achieved without the cluster being accessible from the internet.
