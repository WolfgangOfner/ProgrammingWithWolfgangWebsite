There is light at the end of the tunnel with the pandemic and therefore in person conferences and international travel is coming back. I am excited to travel to Germany and speak at the BASTA! conference in Frankfurt about KEDA.

You can join the session in-person, or remote to learn more about KEDA. If you can't make it to the conference but still want to learn more about KEDA, see [KEDA - Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling](/keda-kubernetes-event-driven-autoscaling)

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## Level Up your Kubernetes Scaling with KEDA

Whether it is a normal workday or Black Friday, service-oriented applications must be able to handle varying loads. This is the only way to ensure that users are provided with a good experience and that costs are kept to a minimum.

Kubernetes offers a way to vary the number of application instances running based on CPU or RAM utilization with the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. However, modern applications often depend on a variety of components and should be able to respond to external events. These may include new messages in a queue or metrics in Azure Monitor.

As an application developer or operation manager, what do I need to consider to ensure that my application can respond to these events? How can I configure Kubernetes for “scale to 0” to run my application only when needed?

Using Azure Kubernetes Service and KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling), this session will show with practical examples how to create and configure autoscalers to respond to external events and scale applications in Kubernetes accordingly.
