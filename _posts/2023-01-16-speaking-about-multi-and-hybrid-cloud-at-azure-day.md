I'm excited to announce that I'll be hosting a session at Azure Day on February 28, 2023, organized by Entwickler.de and the BASTA! conference. Get ready to take your hybrid cloud strategy to the next level with Microsoft Azure technologies!

In this session, we'll be diving deep into Azure Arc and Kubernetes to see how they can help you easily manage and secure your multi-cloud environment while also bringing Azure services to your hardware. We'll be exploring the key features and capabilities of these technologies, and showing real-world examples of how they can optimize workloads, improve compliance, and drive innovation.

So, if you're looking to streamline your IT operations, reduce costs, or simply gain more flexibility, join me at Azure Day. Let's learn from the experts and discover new ways to transform our organizations!

Make sure to check out the website of Azure Day at <a href="https://entwickler.de/azure-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> to learn more and register for the event. I can't wait to see you all there!

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## Unleashing the Potential of Hybrid Cloud: Streamlining Multi-Cloud Management and On-Premises Integration

Most companies use cloud services for their projects nowadays. These companies leverage the seemingly endless scalability and the elastic pricing model of the cloud. Nevertheless, many projects still cannot use cloud services for various reasons. These may encompass regulatory restrictions, data protection, or just having an existing on-premises infrastructure. 

While these are all valid causes, why not combine an existing on-premises infrastructure with the power of the cloud? This is where Azure Arc comes into play. Azure Arc allows to project on-premises infrastructure into Azure and then apply Azure services like Azure Monitor or Azure Policy on the on-premises infrastructure.

This session shows how a Swiss company uses Azure Arc to manage an on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Using Azure Arc enables the development team to leverage the power of the cloud and provide a streamlined DevOps process. All this can be achieved without the cluster being accessible from the internet.
