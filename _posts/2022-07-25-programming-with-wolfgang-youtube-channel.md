As the title already mentions, I have created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiFK5vpvsi6j6gD7W_rsVQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtube channel</a> and uploaded my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L3NDd-tcVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first video</a> explaining how to install Azure Arc to manage an on-premise Kubernetes cluster.

I am not sure yet where this channel will go but for now, I will try to bring you the same educational content as I do on my blog.

If you want to share or introduce a topic, feel free to text me. I am happy to host guests and talk tech.
