I am excited to announce that I will be speaking at MS Tech Summit 2025! My session, titled "From VMs to Managed Pools: Navigating Azure DevOps Agent Hosting," will be available as VOD and will delve into the importance of efficient CI/CD pipelines through flexible and scalable agent hosting.

During this session, we will explore various Azure DevOps agent hosting options tailored to different operational needs and scaling requirements. We will start with Microsoft-hosted agents, a straightforward choice for teams to begin without managing infrastructure. Then, we will cover self-hosted agents on Azure Virtual Machines and Azure VM Scale Sets, offering more control and customization for specific workloads.

Innovative methods like hosting agents within an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster and using Azure Container Apps will also be discussed. These approaches leverage Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) to scale agents based on demand, ensuring efficient resource use. An exciting new solution, Managed DevOps Pools, combines the power and flexibility of VMs with the ease of a managed service. This feature could be a game changer for teams, eliminating the need for manual VM management while providing robust performance and scalability.

Join me for a comprehensive overview of these hosting options, complete with practical demos and expert tips. Whether you are new to Azure DevOps or looking to optimize your existing CI/CD pipelines, this session will provide valuable insights to help you navigate Azure DevOps agent hosting effectively.

I am excited to share my knowledge at MS Tech Summit 2025 and look forward to connecting with you!

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## From VMs to Managed Pools: Navigating Azure DevOps Agent Hosting

Efficient CI/CD pipelines rely on flexible and scalable agent hosting. This session explores the various Azure DevOps agent hosting options, tailored to different operational needs and scaling requirements. 

The session begins with Microsoft-hosted agents, a straightforward choice for teams to start without managing infrastructure. It then covers self-hosted agents on Azure Virtual Machines and Azure VM Scale Sets, which offer more control and customization for specific workloads. Innovative methods like hosting agents within an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster and using Azure Container Apps are also discussed. These approaches leverage Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) to scale agents based on demand, ensuring efficient resource use. 

An exciting new solution, Managed DevOps Pools, combines the power and flexibility of VMs with the ease of a managed service. This feature could be a game changer for teams, eliminating the need for manual VM management while providing robust performance and scalability. 

This session mixes introductions to various hosting options with practical demos, offering tips on when to use each based on your needs.
