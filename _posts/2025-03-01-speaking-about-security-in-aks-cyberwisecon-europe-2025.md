I am pleased to announce that I will be speaking at CyberWiseCon Europe 2025 in Vilnius, Lithuania! My session, titled "AKS Security Simplified: Protecting Your Kubernetes Environment," will delve into the importance of securing Kubernetes clusters in today's digital landscape.

During this session, we will explore how to set up private connections to Azure Container Registry for secure image storage and retrieval. I will cover integrating Azure Policy to enforce security standards across clusters and explain how Entra Workload ID enables secure resource access without managing secrets.

We will also discuss how private clusters enhance security by restricting access to the cluster's API server endpoint. Various authentication options, such as Entra ID, ensure that only authorized users can access your resources. Additionally, I will address the unique challenges of accessing private clusters from Azure DevOps pipelines, explaining how to configure service connections and use managed identities effectively.

Join me for a comprehensive overview of these security features, complete with practical demos and expert tips. Whether you are new to AKS or looking to enhance your existing security measures, this session will provide valuable insights to help you secure your Kubernetes environment effectively.

I am excited about my first visit to Lithuania and look forward to sharing my knowledge at CyberWiseCon Europe 2025!

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## AKS Security Simplified: Protecting Your Kubernetes Environment

Kubernetes is widely adopted for managing containerized applications, making its security a critical concern. This talk will demonstrate that securing your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters—while it may seem challenging—is entirely manageable with the right practices.

This session explores how to set up private connections to Azure Container Registry, ensuring secure image storage and retrieval. It also covers the integration of Azure Policy to enforce security standards across clusters and explains how Entra Workload ID enables secure resource access without the need to manage secrets.

Private clusters enhance security by restricting access to the cluster's API server endpoint. Various authentication options, such as Entra ID, ensure that only authorized users can access your resources. However, accessing private clusters from Azure DevOps pipelines presents unique challenges. This talk will address these challenges by explaining how to configure service connections and use managed identities effectively.

Attend this session for a comprehensive overview of these security features, complete with practical demos and expert tips. Whether you are new to AKS or looking to enhance your existing security measures, this session will provide valuable insights to help you secure your Kubernetes environment effectively.
