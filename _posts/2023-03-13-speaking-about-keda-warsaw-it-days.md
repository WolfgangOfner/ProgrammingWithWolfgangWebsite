I'm excited to let you know that my session, "Scaling to Success: Leveraging KEDA and Kubernetes for Optimal Azure DevOps Pipeline Performance" will be taking place online on March 31, 2023 as part of Warsaw IT Days 2023.

During the talk, we'll be discussing the use of KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling) to scale Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes cluster. I'll be sharing the benefits of using KEDA, such as automatic scaling based on workload, and how it can help improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your pipeline. Plus, I'll be walking you through a demo of how to set up and configure KEDA with Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes cluster.

By attending this session, you'll learn best practices for using KEDA to optimize your pipeline and gain a deeper understanding of how to leverage Kubernetes for scaling your DevOps operations. The session will be held online, so you can join from anywhere in the world.

To register for the event, head over to the <a href="https://warszawskiedniinformatyki.pl/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conference website</a>. I hope to see you there on March 31, 2023!

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## Scaling to Success: Leveraging KEDA and Kubernetes for Optimal Azure DevOps Pipeline Performance

In this talk, we will discuss the use of KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling) to scale Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes cluster. We will cover the benefits of using KEDA, such as automatic scaling based on workload, and how it can improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your pipeline. 

There will also be a demonstration of how to set up and configure KEDA with Azure DevOps pipeline agents in a Kubernetes cluster. Attendees will learn best practices for using KEDA to optimize their pipeline and gain a deeper understanding of how to leverage Kubernetes for scaling their DevOps operations
