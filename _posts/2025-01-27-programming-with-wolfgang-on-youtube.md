Starting this February, I will publish a new YouTube video every Tuesday at 9:15 AM ET on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProgrammingWithWolfgang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProgrammingWithWolfgang Youtube Channel</a>. I will cover topics like Azure, AKS, and Azure DevOps but also what I encounter during my work days that might be interesting.

If you prefer reading, I will also post an edited version of the video's transcript on my blog. You can watch the video or read the transcript.

Tune in on Tuesdays at 9:15 AM ET. I look forward to sharing.
