I am excited to announce that I will be speaking at TestCon 2024! My session, titled "Optimizing Test Environments with Azure DevOps and Kubernetes" will delve into the importance of creating resilient and error-resistant applications in today's digital landscape.

During this session, we will explore how automated unit and integration tests can ensure functionality and correctness, and when manual checks are necessary. I will demonstrate the process of automatically setting up a dedicated testing environment, complete with all dependencies, including a database filled with test data and an SSL certificate.

Using practical examples, we will see how Azure DevOps and Azure Kubernetes Service can streamline this process, enabling stakeholders and non-technical people to test new features effortlessly.

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## Optimizing Test Environments with Azure DevOps and Kubernetes 

In today's digital landscape, it's crucial for applications to be resilient and error-resistant to ensure a seamless user experience. Automated unit and integration tests can be employed to verify functionality and correctness, thereby assuring the desired quality.

However, there may be instances where manual checks of new features are required during a pull request. This necessitates deploying the application in a distinct environment to prevent any interference with existing applications. This testing environment should be equipped with all necessary components, including a database filled with test data and an SSL certificate.

This session will demonstrate the process of establishing a new environment, complete with all dependencies and certificate management, using practical examples. The procedure, implemented using Azure DevOps and Azure Kubernetes Service, will enable stakeholders to test new features effortlessly.
