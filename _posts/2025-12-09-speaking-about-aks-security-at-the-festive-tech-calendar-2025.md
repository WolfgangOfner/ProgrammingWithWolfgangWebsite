It’s the most wonderful time of the year—not just for the holidays, but for incredible community tech content! I’m excited to share that I am wrapping up my year of public speaking by participating in the annual **Festive Tech Calendar 2025** community event.

This event is truly special: every single day this month, a new, free tech session is released, offering tons of learning opportunities for developers and engineers.

## My Session: AKS Security Simplified for Developers

I will be contributing my session later this month, sharing some of my best practices on a critical topic: **AKS Security.**

My talk, **"AKS Security Simplified for Developers,"** will cover essential strategies and configurations you need to implement to ensure your Azure Kubernetes Service workloads are resilient, secure, and compliant.

## An Incredible Cause: Beatson Cancer Charity

What makes the Festive Tech Calendar so great is its mission to give back. This entire event is dedicated to raising money for an incredible organization: the **Beatson Cancer Charity**.

I believe in supporting their vital work, and by checking out the event, you are contributing to this tradition of giving. Please consider supporting them directly:

The abstract for my session is as follows:

## AKS Security Simplified for Developers

Kubernetes is widely adopted for managing containerized applications, therefore, ensuring its security is crucial. This talk will demonstrate that securing your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters, while it may seem challenging, is quite manageable with the right practices. 

This session explores setting up private connections to Azure Container Registry, enabling secure image storage and retrieval. It also covers integrating Azure Policy to enforce security standards across your clusters, and how Entra Workload ID provides secure access to resources without the need for managing secrets. 

Private clusters enhance the security by restricting access to the cluster's API server endpoint. Various authentication options, such as using Entra ID, ensure that only authorized users can access your resources. However, accessing private clusters from CI/CD pipelines presents unique challenges. This talk addresses these by explaining how to configure service connections and use managed identities effectively. 

Attend this session for a comprehensive overview of these security features, complete with practical demos and expert tips. Whether you are new to AKS or looking to enhance your existing security measures, this session will provide valuable insights to help you secure your Kubernetes environment effectively.
